In this study, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of various machine-learning models for intrusion detection using the NSL-KDD dataset. 
Our analysis involved preprocessing, feature selection using PCA and Decision Tree methods, and rigorous evaluation of model performance 
across multiple metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and execution time.

From our experiments, it is evident that decision tree-based models such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting consistently outperform other 
algorithms in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall on both the KDDTrain+ and KDDTest+ datasets. These models demonstrated robust performance 
in handling the complexities and varied nature of network intrusion detection tasks.

Moreover, SVM also showed competitive performance, particularly on the KDDTrain+ dataset, highlighting its suitability for scenarios requiring
high precision and recall rates. However, it should be noted that SVM exhibited longer execution times compared to other algorithms, indicating a 
trade-off between computational efficiency and model effectiveness.
